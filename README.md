# React Training Workshop

`npm install` will give you everything you need. There is a server, but it serves out data from memory (no database needed)

  - `npm run server` to run the server
  - `npm run client` to run the react app

Each branch has a fully functioning project.
  - `master` has a component based project, no redux, no react router. **GOAL**: Convert to functional components and hooks. 
  - `step1` branch has the solution for the above challenge.
  - `step2` branch has a solution that includes react-router (no redux). 
  - `step3` branch has a solution that includes react-router AND redux AND redux-sagas
